Some formalizations of Eugenia Cheng's book joy of abstraction.
This is help to deepen my own understanding of cat ðŸ˜¼.

# TODO

1. try and define an isMonoid y -> Category {x = Unit.T} (\ a b -> y)
2. define the category for sets and function (eg chapter 12)
3. try the 60 prime factorization cateogry as well.
   seems a lot less abstract and I can't think of an obvious way of doing this??
